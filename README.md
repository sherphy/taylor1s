Just a super duper quick minimal UI 30 lines 1 hour project because no one believes I can identify a Taylor song within the first second
Very extremely easy to change playlists, just chuck the spotify link in
Had bigger plans to make this into a game where it checks your answer but didn't have time

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
